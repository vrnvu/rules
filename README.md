## ideas

- **Deterministic Simulation**: Controlled, reproducible testing with seeded randomness
- **Model-Based Testing**: Reference implementation comparison for behavior validation
- **Property-Based Testing**: Automated test generation with invariant checking
- **Swarm Testing**: Non-uniform operation distribution for edge case discovery
- **Snapshot Testing**: Data-driven assertions with self-updating capabilities
- **Compile-Time Testing**: Rust compile/build failure testing for type safety
- **Integration Testing**: Complete system workflows without mocks
- **Race Condition Testing**: Concurrent execution with deterministic timing
- **Failure Injection**: Controlled error scenarios and recovery testing
- **Performance Testing**: Latency, throughput, and resource usage validation
